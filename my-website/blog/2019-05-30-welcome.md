I posted a similar topic at another board regarding A Realm Reborn - D'horme Chimera side quest. However, got the following response:
Someone answer: The Chimaera fight, as well as all the others in the relic quest, is in the duty finder. Just queue up for it (it's under "trials") like you would for any other dungeon or trial.


Then, I questioned the above answer: Are you sure? A few of the videos on youtube regarding this quest states that it cannot be found in the "duty finder". Was this quest fixed with a patch? Anyhow thank you. ( yes it is in there ,,, you have to go to the destination first then the duty finder will update.)

By the way, I found this here in a Wiki page: Part 3: Alumina Salts Main article: A Relic Reborn: The Chimera You now need to defeat Dhorme Chimera and obtain Alumina Salt from the 8-man trial A Relic Reborn: The Chimera while as the job that equips the relic weapon. The entrance to A Relic Reborn: The Chimera can be found at Coerthas Central Highlands (X-32, Y-6). Afterwards report back to Gerolt.

Could someone clarify the so-called "Someone answer"? Is it or is it not this quest found in the "duty finder"? Thanks. (yes it is) (This 8 man can be done unsynced)
