## A Nocturne for Heroes (FF15 collaboration event) separate pages

When the 2021 rerun of A Nocturne for Heroes started, someone created a separate page for the rerun. There are 2 separate pages: A Nocturne for Heroes (2019) and A Nocturne for Heroes (2021). I think this should be reverted, and merged back into a single page.

The 2021 event is a direct repeat/rerun of the 2019 run. Other events, such as Yo-kai Watch: Gather One, Gather All!, There's Golems in Those Hills!, and The Maiden's Rhapsody have had multiple runs, and they each only have a single page. Each run of these events had the same story, quests, items, etc, with only minor variations.

By contrast, the holiday events typically are completely different each year, with different stories, quests, and rewards with each run. For example, All Saints' Wake (2017) and All Saints' Wake (2019) are completely different. Also, each Moogle Treasure Trove event has a different set of tasks and rewards. Thus, it makes sense to have separate pages for each run.

The 2021 run of A Nocturne for Heroes is an exact copy/repeat of the 2019 version. There is no reason to have a separate page.
